# Find WebP
# -------------
#
# Finds the WebP library. This module defines:
#
#  WebP_FOUND           - True if WebP library is found
#  WebP::WebP           - WebP imported target
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  WebP_LIBRARY         - WebP library
#  WebP_INCLUDE_DIR     - Include dir

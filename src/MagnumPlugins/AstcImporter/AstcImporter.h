@brief ASTC importer plugin
@m_since_latest_{plugins}

Imports 2D and 3D ASTC (`*.astc`) files produced by
[ARM ASTC encoder](https://github.com/ARM-software/astc-encoder) and other
texture compression tools.

@section Trade-AstcImporter-usage Usage

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
    This class is a plugin that's meant to be dynamically loaded and used
    through the base @ref AbstractImporter interface. See its documentation for
    introduction and usage examples.

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`MAGNUM_WITH_ASTCIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use as a
dynamic plugin, load @cpp "AstcImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following:

@code{.cmake}
set(MAGNUM_WITH_ASTCIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::AstcImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `AstcImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package in CMake and link to the `MagnumPlugins::AstcImporter`
target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED AstcImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::AstcImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-AstcImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

By default, images are imported with @ref CompressedPixelFormat::Astc4x4RGBAUnorm
to @relativeref{CompressedPixelFormat,Astc12x12RGBAUnorm} for 2D ASTC
compression and @relativeref{CompressedPixelFormat,Astc3x3x3RGBAUnorm} to
@relativeref{CompressedPixelFormat,Astc6x6x6RGBAUnorm} for 3D ASTC compression.
The file format contains only information about block size but not about the
actual type of data, thus to get `*RGBASrgb` and `*RGBAF` formats instead of
`*RGBAUnorm` you have to explicitly set the @cb{.ini} format @ce
@ref Trade-AstcImporter-configuration "configuration option".

Files with 3D ASTC blocks are always exposed as 3D images instead of 2D.
Additionally, if a file has 2D ASTC blocks but the Z size is not 1 (a 2D array
texture), the image is also exposed as 3D, with @ref ImageFlag3D::Array set.
The ARM ASTC encoder doesn't seem to support such scenario (the `-array`
option enforces use of a 3D ASTC format), but other tools might.

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Imported image orientation
    Unlike @ref Trade-KtxImporter-behavior "KTX" or
    @ref Trade-BasisImporter-behavior "Basis", the file format doesn't contain
    any orientation metadata, and so it's assumed to follow the Vulkan/D3D
    coordinate system with Y down and (for 3D textures) Z forward. Because
    flipping block-compressed data is nontrivial, the image will not be flipped
    on import, instead a message will be printed to @relativeref{Magnum,Warning}
    and the data will be passed through unchanged. Set the
    @cb{.ini} assumeYUpZBackward @ce @ref Trade-AstcImporter-configuration "configuration option"
    to assume the OpenGL coordinate system and silence the warning.

The plugin recognizes @ref ImporterFlag::Quiet, which will cause all import
warnings to be suppressed.

@section Trade-AstcImporter-configuration Plugin-specific configuration

It's possible to tune various import options through @ref configuration(). See
below for all options and their default values:

@snippet MagnumPlugins/AstcImporter/AstcImporter.conf configuration_

See @ref plugins-configuration for more information and an example showing how
to edit the configuration values.

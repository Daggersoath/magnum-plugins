@brief HarfBuzz font plugin

@m_keywords{TrueTypeFont OpenTypeFont}

Improves @ref FreeTypeFont with text shaping capabilities provided by the
[HarfBuzz](https://harfbuzz.github.io) library.

This plugin provides the `TrueTypeFont` and `OpenTypeFont` plugins.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the [HarfBuzz](https://harfbuzz.github.io)
    library, licensed under @m_class{m-label m-success} **MIT**
    ([license text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/main/COPYING),
    [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)). It
    requires attribution for public use. In turn it depends on @ref FreeTypeFont
    and thus FreeType, see its documentation for further license info.

@section Text-HarfBuzzFont-usage Usage

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
    This class is a plugin that's meant to be dynamically loaded and used
    through the base @ref AbstractFont interface. See its documentation for
    introduction and usage examples.

This plugin depends on the @ref Text and [HarfBuzz](https://harfbuzz.github.io)
libraries and the @ref FreeTypeFont plugin. It is built if
`MAGNUM_WITH_HARFBUZZFONT` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use as a
dynamic plugin, load @cpp "HarfBuzzFont" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following. Using HarfBuzz itself as a CMake subproject isn't tested at the
moment, so you need to provide it as a system dependency and point
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if necessary.

@code{.cmake}
set(MAGNUM_WITH_HARFBUZZFONT ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::HarfBuzzFont)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake,
request the `HarfBuzzFont` component of the `MagnumPlugins` package and link to
the `MagnumPlugins::HarfBuzzFont` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED HarfBuzzFont)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::HarfBuzzFont)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins amd
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Text-HarfBuzzFont-behavior Behavior and limitations

This plugin implements @ref AbstractShaper::setScript(),
@relativeref{AbstractShaper,setLanguage()} and
@relativeref{AbstractShaper,setDirection()}. With HarfBuzz 5.2+ all
@ref Script values are supported, with older versions the function will return
@cpp false @ce if given script value is not supported. See documentation of the
@m_class{m-doc-external} [hb_script_t](https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-common.html#hb-script-t)
enum for more information about which scripts are supported on which version.

If @ref AbstractShaper::setScript(), @relativeref{AbstractShaper,setLanguage()}
or @relativeref{AbstractShaper,setDirection()} isn't called or it's explicitly
set to unspecified values, the library will attempt to guess the properties.
Script and direction is guessed from the input text passed to
@ref AbstractShaper::shape(), the language HarfBuzz currently detects from
system locale. The actual properties used for shaping are then exposed through
@ref AbstractShaper::script(), @relativeref{AbstractShaper,language()} and
@relativeref{AbstractShaper,direction()}.

Reusing an @ref AbstractShaper instance that has the script, language or
direction left unspecified will attempt to guess these properties anew for
every new shaped text. On the other hand, if a concrete script, language or
direction value is set, it stays used for subsequent shaped text.

@subsection Text-HarfBuzzFont-behavior-features Typographic features

HarfBuzz [enables the following features by default](https://harfbuzz.github.io/shaping-opentype-features.html):

-   @ref Feature::AboveBaseForms
-   @ref Feature::BelowBaseForms
-   @ref Feature::GlyphCompositionDecomposition
-   @ref Feature::LocalizedForms
-   @ref Feature::MarkPositioning
-   @ref Feature::MarkToMarkPositioning
-   @ref Feature::RequiredLigatures

Additionally, for @ref ShapeDirection::LeftToRight or
@ref ShapeDirection::RightToLeft, HarfBuzz enables the following by default:

-   @ref Feature::ContextualAlternates
-   @ref Feature::ContextualLigatures
-   @ref Feature::CursivePositioning
-   @ref Feature::Distances
-   @ref Feature::Kerning
-   @ref Feature::StandardLigatures
-   @ref Feature::RequiredContextualAlternates

Additionally, when HarfBuzz encounters a fraction slash (`⁄`, U+2044), it looks
backward and forward for decimal digits, enables @ref Feature::Numerators on
the sequence before the slash, @ref Feature::Denominators on the sequence after
the slash and @ref Feature::Fractions on the whole sequence including the
slash.

For @ref ShapeDirection::TopToBottom or @ref ShapeDirection::BottomToTop,
HarfBuzz enables @ref Feature::VerticalWriting by default.

For @ref Script::Hangul, HarfBuzz disables @ref Feature::ContextualAlternates
by default. For Indic scripts and @ref Script::Khmer, HarfBuzz disables
@ref Feature::StandardLigatures by default.
